Based on the provided data, it's evident that the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm demonstrates the highest level of efficiency among the considered scheduling algorithms. This conclusion is drawn from the following observations:

- The average waiting time for SJF is 23.75, which is the lowest among all the algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling (PS), and Round Robin (RR)).
- The average turnaround time for SJF is 50.0, which is also the lowest compared to FCFS, PS, and RR.

Therefore, based on these performance metrics, Shortest Job First proves to be the most efficient scheduling algorithm in this particular scenario. Additionally, the optimal order for attending to patients, based on the SJF principle, is A, D, B, and C.
